This is a javascript browser game I made that takes the simple Rock Paper Scissors engine and attempts to expand upon it by building the typical 'free to play' gameplay elements on top of it. So there would be buyable characters, new skins, etc. but nothing would affect the basic mechanic of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

I have done two iterations of the game so far and it is playable with a few bugs. I need to do one more complete code re-write to put in place some of the best practices I have been reading about. Currently it is pretty hacked together, but it does work. As this is supposed to be an excersice in learning javascript I'm more concerned than I otherwise would be in completely eliminating bugs from the code and solving all the problems as efficiently as possible.

The game itself is very simple and uses jquery to manipulate DOM elements. There are still several major features that are lacking before I can completely go public with it and I need to add those in once the code is cleaned up. Here is what I need to do:

<ul>
	<li>Re-write the code as modules.</li>
	<li>Set up the code on server and get it public.</li>
	<li>Implement sound!</li>
	<li>Add a menu system (New Game, Options, Etc.)</li>
	<li>Add a payment system to unlock characters!</li>
</ul>
