The Hermit Country blog is now live. Rather than try to make it awesome and add all the features I want I decided to just use an existing theme (the open source [DBYLL](https://github.com/dbtek/dbyll)) and spend more time working on other projects. At some point I will come back to the frontend of this blog and redo it but for now it is very functional and looks nice. It has all the contact information right there and presents everything in an easy to navigate manner. 

This afternoon I'm going to see ["Black Coal, Thin Ice" / "白日焰火"](http://www.siff.net/festival-2014/black-coal-thin-ice) (Dir. Zhang Yang / 張揚) as part of the Seattle International Film Festival. This will be the final film I'm seeing as part of the festival. So far all the screenings I've been to at the festival have bad awesome 'extras' like actors from the film joing the screening and doing Q&As or having live music accompaniment. Kudos to SIFF for putting on a great festival and giving people some incentives to watch movies at the theater!
